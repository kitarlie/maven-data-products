'''
Bow shock model, taken from the experimental fit data from Hall et al. (2016) Annual variations in the Martian bow shock location as observed by the Mars Express mission.

Note: this model is in [aberrated MSO coordinates]; this is a coordinate system rotated about the Z-axis by 4 degrees from the typical MSO coordinates, to account for the angle of solar wind incidence at Mars.
      To use this model with data in MSO coordinates, the inverse 4 degree rotation must be applied first.
